 Reciprocal Unit Cell volume =     2.061302 Angstroms^-3 (  109902239 k-points)   Vol of 1 k-point =  0.000000018756 Angstroms^-3
 Band electron (occupied) volume =     0.141782 Angstroms^-3 (    7559397 k-points), Roughly estimated number of electrons in this band** =   0.137566
 Band hole (unoccupied) volume =     1.919519 Angstroms^-3 (  102342842 k-points), Roughly estimated number of holes in this band** =   1.862434
 (E_F - E_bandminimum)/E_bandwidth =   0.272479
 **Either the estimated number of electrons (for an electron-like band) or holes (for a hole-like band) calculated above should be used. 
 
 Contribution of this band to the DOS(E_F) =   13.759 Angstroms^-3 Rydbergs^-1 per spin direction
 (i.e. # of states per volume per energy per spin direction, at the Fermi energy)
